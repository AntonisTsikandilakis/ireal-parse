# ireal-parse

This is a script that parses [charts from ireal pro](http://www.irealb.com/forums/) into a convenient JSON format. We use pianosnake's [ireal-reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ireal-reader) to achieve this.

## Small Warning

ireal pro seems to make regular [updates](https://github.com/rubiety/irealb_parser) to its chart syntax, hence this may not work forever

## Usage

Parse 1300 jazz charts
```
node parse_full.js
```
